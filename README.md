# Air Maestro

Air Maestro is my final summative for ICS4U. It is a program written in Processing whose sole input (aside from some initial calibration) comes from a webcam. The maestro (that's you) can conduct with one baton or several (anything with a distinct, bright colour at its end), each one controlling a separate audio track.
